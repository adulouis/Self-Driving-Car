## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a self-driving car system capable of:
- Detecting and following lanes on the road.
- Recognizing and responding to traffic signs.

This project leverages various computer vision and machine learning algorithms to process video input from a front-facing camera on the 3d car model and make driving decisions based on the detected lanes and traffic signs.

## Features

- Lane Detection: Detects lane lines on the road using computer vision techniques such as edge detection, color thresholding, and Hough Transform.
- Traffic Sign Detection: Identifies and classifies traffic signs using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
- Real-time Processing: Processes video frames in real-time to provide immediate feedback and control.
- Simulation Environment: Simulates the self-driving car behavior in Gazebo environment using ROS2.
